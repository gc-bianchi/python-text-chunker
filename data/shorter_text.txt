Galileo Galilei revolutionized the field of astronomy by challenging the geocentric model of the universe. Using his telescope, Galileo provided evidence supporting the heliocentric theory, which stated that the planets orbit around the Sun. His observations, including the moons of Jupiter, contradicted the long-held belief that all celestial bodies revolved around the Earth.

Isaac Newton later built upon these discoveries, formulating the laws of motion and universal gravitation. Newtonâ€™s work laid the foundation for classical physics, providing a unified framework for understanding the natural world that remained unchallenged for centuries.

In the 20th century, Albert Einstein introduced the theory of relativity, which redefined the concepts of space and time. Einstein's theories, along with the development of quantum mechanics, transformed the landscape of modern physics and led to technologies that continue to shape our world today.
